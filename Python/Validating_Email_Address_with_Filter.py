#You are given an integer  followed by  email addresses. Your task is to print a list containing only valid email addresses in lexicographical order.


#Valid email addresses must follow these rules:

#It must have the username@websitename.extension format type.
#The username can only contain letters, digits, dashes and underscores.
#The website name can only have letters and digits.
#The maximum length of the extension is . 

#Concept

#A filter takes a function returning True or False and applies it to a sequence, returning a list of only those members of the sequence where the function returned True. A Lambda function can be used with filters. 

#Let's say you have to make a list of the squares of integers from  to  (both included).

#>> l = list(range(10))
#>> l = list(map(lambda x:x*x, l))
#Now, you only require those elements that are greater than  but less than .

#>> l = list(filter(lambda x: x > 10 and x < 80, l))
#Easy, isn't it?

#Input Format

#The first line of input is the integer , the number of email addresses. 
 #lines follow, each containing a string.

#Constraints

#Each line is a non-empty string.

#Output Format

#Output a list containing the valid email addresses in lexicographical order. If the list is empty, just output an empty list, [].

#Sample Input

#3
#lara@hackerrank.com
#brian-23@hackerrank.com
#britts_54@hackerrank.com
#Sample Output
